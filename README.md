# ACCAD6 Capstone Project
By Ryan, Kon Chern and Oswald

## Our App (Banana Clicker)
We created an app where users can click to get (bananas). 

### User flow
A user entering the app will first have to login with a username. If the user signs in with a unique username, they would enter the game with 0 (bananas). If the user is logging in to an existing account, the user would enter the game with their last saved number of (bananas) under that username. When the user wants to save their number of (bananas), they can click the `Save` button in the game. If the user wants to delete their account, they can click the `Delete Account` button in the game before being redirected back to the login screen.
